	"""Run the specified command (string) repeatedly, and estimate the
	run time. Like ipython's magic %timeit command, but unlike the normal
	python timeit, the environment is inherited from the calling frame.
	This means that you can usually call it directly without bothering with
	the 'setup' argument.
	
	Like %itimeit, the number of iterations is automatically adjusted
	such that the run time takes between repeat*tmin and repeat*tmin*10 seconds
	(or repeat times the time for a single evaluation if greater). This gives
	a useful compromise between accuracy and run time. The final time estimate
	is the shortest run time out of the repetitions, divided by the number of
	iterations per repetition.

	If you don't want to use the caller's environment, you can override this
	by passing in dictionaries to use for locals and globals in their
	respective arguments.

	If 'baseline' is specified, it should be a command string whose time will
	be subtracted from the estimate. For example, baseline="pass" will subtract
	the time an empty loop takes, which will approximately compensate for the
	benchmark overhead. Because the speed of a statement depends on what statements
	ran before it, among other things, this isn't necessarily very accurate, and
	can result in negative times for when command and baseline take almost the
	same time.

	The 'mode' argument controls how the results are reported.
	'p': Print the result in %timeit format
	't': Return the estimated run time for the command
	'f': Return a dictionary with more detailed information.
	
	Examples:
		>itimeit("1+1")
		10000000 loops, best of 3: 21.03 ns per loop

		>itimeit("1+1", baseline="pass")
		10000000 loops, best of 3: 4.367 ns per loop

		# Access functions and modules without a cumbersome setup
		>def foo(i):
			while i != 0:
				i /= 2
		>itimeit("foo(100)")
		1000000 loops, best of 3: 593.7 ns per loop

		>itimeit("np.random.standard_normal((1000,1000))")
		10 loops, best of 3: 72.01 ms per loop

		# The cost of this is that the environment is affected
		# when timing mutating commands.
		>a = np.arange(10)
		>def bar(a): a += 1
		1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.145 µs per loop
